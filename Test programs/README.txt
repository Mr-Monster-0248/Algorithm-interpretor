Pseudo-code program: *.pc.txt
Expected output: *.out.txt

For files expr* and var*, the expected output is given in _debug_ mode (i.e. the interpreter evaluates any expression in the program and outputs its result, even though there is no write statement).

For files io*, the expected output is given in _regular_ mode (i.e. only write statements produce output).
